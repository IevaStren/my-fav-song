Saying I love you
Is not the words I want to hear from you
It's not that I want to
Not to say, but if you only knew
How easy it would be to show me how you feel

More than words
Is all you have to do to make it real
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'Cause I'd already know

What would you do if my heart was torn in two?
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real

What would you say if I took those words away?
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying I love you
